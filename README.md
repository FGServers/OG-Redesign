## OG Redesign What is it?
It is a project that we carried out with Gonzalo, jelc23 more than 3 years ago studying the ogame code, leaving behind versions bearing fruit, being able to remove the famous javascript to make it work for the moment we do not want to separate ourselves from XGProyect, with this project we want to help the community is bigger. although it will not have everything of ogame as for example, El Chatarraro, The importer and Exporter, The auctioneer, The obtaining resources, The new system of friends, The team command, Purchase of dark matter, as well as The store and the accelerators . Hopefully, this project will be taken into account by lucky, even though it will be invited to be part of the saying. I also hope that gonza does not kill me for publishing the redesign but. Know this is a terrible effort on my part and Gonzalo did a lot in the redesign that is working in Programarg, but this version will only have limited things as we move forward with the XGP version we will see if we integrate things and / or adapting

Thank you very much and greetings from Gonzalo, JonaMiX and Jelc23 XGP TEAM FREELANCER

## Who is using OG Redesign?
Until the version does not have stable functions, the pack will not be profitable or functional, this is something that will change as it improves. Have in mind that it is a lot of reprogramming, adaptation and improvements apart will have different things that layers to the programmers we like like programming in several languages ​​or messy code, etc, etc, etc.

## In what language will it work?
At the moment I will be in two languages ​​that are worked in parallel one will be in Spanish and the other in English, I can contact with BeReal to program the part in Turkish
